## Technical writing

> Generic sample topics, in English, of a description and procedure are under construction and will be available shortly. In the meantime...

I have created a use and maintenance manual, in Swedish, for a family member's Finnish sauna: [Sauna manual](https://ordvild.se/bastumanual). The end result was mainly a printed version, hence no linking between topics.

### Past technical writing at Snow Software (now Flexera)

I wrote all the docs for the new SaaS product Snow SaaS Management (now Flexera One SaaS Management) from 2021 up until July 2024, when I left the company. The docs were written and maintained in Markdown, according to topic-based writing principles and the technical communication team’s writing guidelines:

[https://docs-snow.flexera.com/snow-atlas/user-documentation/saas/](https://docs-snow.flexera.com/snow-atlas/user-documentation/saas/) 

Content under `/saas/browser-extension/token-broker-proxy/install-token-broker-proxy/` and `/saas/browser-extension/token-broker-proxy/` was co-created with a fellow technical writer.

> **DISCLAIMER**
> 
> Content under `/saas/` may have been updated after I left (I would be surprised if not!).
> 
> Content that has been added after I left includes, but is not restricted to, `/saas/data-imports/`, `/saas/currency/`and docs for the SaaS connectors for Jira, Confluence, Coupa, Docusign, SAP SuccessFactors and Slack.

I also helped update the content under `/docs-snow.flexera.com/snow-atlas-api/resources/` as well as the Snow Atlas REST API guidelines for developers (not publicly available) in 2024.

## UX writing

At Snow Software (now Flexera) I also did the UX writing for the new SaaS product Snow SaaS Management (now Flexera One SaaS Management) from around 2022 up until I left in July 2024. This entailed writing and reviewing both microcopy and contextual help snippets, as well as ensuring consistent terminology across the product and user guide.

Since the product was B2B, I have no UX writing samples to show here right now.

## Editor and reviewer work

I was editor for the research document [I modern, valan och den heliga hästens spår](https://sofiainstitutet.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/I-modern-valan-och-den-heliga-hastens-spar-Agneta-Nyholm-Sofiainstitutet-20250611-komp-1.pdf), where my role was primarily to format an unstructured draft into a publishable version by applying styles, do the layout, and help the author tie up loose ends. This was pro-bono work for [Sofiainstitutet](https://sofiainstitutet.se/). I did the work in Apple Pages.

I was also reviewer and proofreader for the book [Naturens rättigheter](https://naturensrattigheter.se/2020/03/24/boken-naturens-rattigheter-att-skapa-fred-med-jorden/) in 2020.

## Freelance writing

Articles about feet and functional footwear, in Swedish, that I wrote around 2020:

- [Den raska promenadens död](http://ordvild.se/den-raska-promenadens-dod)
- [Att upptäcka springningen](http://ordvild.se/att-upptacka-springningen)
- [Vandringens återkomst](http://ordvild.se/vandringens-aterkomst)
- [Frigör dina fötter, kvinna!](http://ordvild.se/frigor-dina-fotter-kvinna)

## Markdown experimenting

My CV and cover letters are created in Markdown – because I just love it – and converted to PDF for compatibility reasons in application systems.

My CV is an exercise in Markdown tables and how to get it right and readable when converting to PDF. Unfortunately, GitHub Pages does not handle tables well so I cannot upload my CV Markdown file here. Refer to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-skenhall-6999a71a0) for my professional qualifications.
