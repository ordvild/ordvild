| **ABOUT ME** | **CONTACT DETAILS** |
| I love working with words, text, and information, preferably in a fast-paced, agile software development setting. I am curious, quickly learn new tools and concepts, and find stimulation in breaking new ground. With a high attention to detail, I am skilled in analysing, understanding and describing a complex system in a simplified way as a coherent whole.<br>As a team player I thrive when I can build relationships through collaboration towards a common goal. I always strive for high quality and often focus on improving processes to make them more efficient. I have experience of working in an international setting, often remotely. | *Phone:* +46706076026<br><br>*Email:* skenhall@protonmail.com<br><br>*Location:* Lund, Sweden<br><br>*LinkedIn profile:*<br>www.linkedin.com/in/sara-skenhall-6999a71a0 |
